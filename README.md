# Hello Tests! With Jest

Your tasks are:

## [Vanilla JS] To create tests for each function of utils.js in utils.spec.js.

For each:

- A description of the function
- A test to make the function works
- A test to make the function fails

## [Vanilla JS] With a TDD approach:

- Create the tests (in phone.spec.js) to check if a number is a German phone number, for example:
- The format can be +491 000 000000
- The format can be +491000000000
- The format can be 01000000000

Then, and only then, create the function to check if a phone number is German (in phone.js).
Would your function be the same without the tests before?

## [React] using Enzyme with the button that reads I'm an awesome button

- Test if the text is "I'm an awesome button"
- Simulate a click
- Test if the text is "I'm not a super awesome button?"
- Check if the color is red
